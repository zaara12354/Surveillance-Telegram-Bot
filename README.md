# Surveillance Telegram Bot

This repository contains a Python-based surveillance Telegram bot that allows users to control and monitor a system efficiently. The bot is designed to work seamlessly with Telegram and provides a user-friendly interface for admin control.

## Features

- **Customizable Time Gaps:** Admins can set up time intervals for repeated actions.
- **Configurable Time Loops:** Admins can define the number of repetitions or loops for scheduled tasks.
- **Smooth Telegram Integration:** The bot is highly responsive and ensures stable communication.
- **Standalone Executable:** Built using `pyinstaller`, the bot can run as a standalone `.exe` file.

## Installation
